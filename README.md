Add this to your HTML:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@your-org/wishlist-dock/dist/wishlist-dock.es.js"></script>
<wishlist-dock data-theme="dark"></wishlist-dock>
```

### For React Apps

### State Management

The app uses Zustand for state management with the following key features:

- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately, syncs with API in background
- **Rollback on Error**: Reverts changes if API calls fail
- **Persistence**: Syncs with localStorage for offline support

### Component Architecture

- **Dock**: Main container with open/close animations
- **StacksList**: Displays all stacks with grid layout
- **StackView**: Shows cards within a selected stack
- **SwipeCards**: Tinder-like card swiping experience
- **CardItem**: Individual card with actions

## Design Decisions

### Why Zustand over Redux/Context?
- Minimal boilerplate
- Built-in devtools support
- Easy async actions without middleware
- Subscriptions for selective re-renders

### Why Framer Motion?
- Declarative animations
- Gesture support (drag, swipe)
- AnimatePresence for exit animations
- Great performance

### Why Tailwind CSS?
- Rapid prototyping
- Consistent design system
- Small bundle size with purging
- Easy responsive design

## Trade-offs

1. **Web Component vs iframe**: Chose to prepare Web Component wrapper for better integration, but full Shadow DOM support would need more testing

2. **Mock API vs Real Backend**: Used mock API with simulated delays to demonstrate optimistic UI patterns without backend complexity

3. **Swipe Library**: Implemented custom swipe logic with Framer Motion instead of external library for full control over animations

4. **Image Placeholders**: Using picsum.photos for demo images - production would use actual user-provided URLs

## Future Improvements

With more time, I would add:

1. **Testing**: Unit tests with Vitest, component tests with React Testing Library
2. **Drag & Drop**: Full drag-and-drop reordering with @dnd-kit (library already installed)
3. **Advanced Search**: Search within cards and filter by multiple criteria
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Navigate with keyboard for accessibility (Esc, Arrow keys, etc.)
5. **Offline Support**: Service worker for full offline capability
6. **Code Splitting**: Lazy load swipe mode and modals for better performance
7. **i18n**: Internationalization support for multiple languages
8. **Analytics**: Track user interactions and usage patterns
9. **Share Functionality**: Share stacks with others via URL or export
10. **Real Backend**: Connect to actual API with authentication and user accounts
11. **Favorites**: Star/favorite important stacks and cards for quick access
